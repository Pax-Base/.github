## Why bother?

### _"Use a proprietary operating system(OS) instead. Windows and MacOS exist!"_
In addition to the very important and reasonably valid privacy and trustworthiness concerns (there are great online commentaries on this), let us not forget that underprivileged people exist and they often have to overcome multiple barriers before they can fruitfully use computing to alleviate their socioeconomic situation - this involves gaining access to computing hardware, and also gaining access to the relevant software. 
Overcoming the first barrier requires capital investment, whereas overcoming the second barrier does not have to. 
Contribution of time and effort by the community of smart and skilled open source developers all over the world can bring financially productive computing to those who are financially disadvantaged. This noble goal is well within the reach of humans without having to make any big compromises. Underfunded institutions can ease the strain on their resources by using a FOSS OS like Linux instead of proprietary ones which charge licensing fees.

### _"Users just don't want to learn. It is a skill issue!"_
Although it is good for individuals to _want_ to invest their time in learning about, and maintaining their software, communities that focus on this philosophy also often breed an attitude that is toxic towards users who just want to get their task done. 
A community for a Linux distribution (distro) does these users no favours when they make disparaging remarks to such users for just wanting a solution so that they can move on with their goals.
There are users who have a busy life and goals to meet, you know. 
Often these goals are more important than learning how to fix every problem that can arise with their operating system. 
Such communities often push some users to just use proprietary OSs like Windows or MacOS.

Is this a reasonable attitude to have? 
Let us attempt to answer this question by asking some rhetorical questions.
Would you really admonish a researcher who is working hard to find a treatment for a deadly disease just because they did not want to spend their day learning how to troubleshoot their OS so that it would boot?
Would you be _that_ person who dictates that others spend their time learning the inner workings of Linux (even if they don't want to)? 
How is that any nobler than someone else dictating them to learn medicine to save lives (even if they don't want to)?

## How will it work?

Simplifying the use of Linux can break down the major hurdles that users have, to using it for their workflows.
The OS (and software in general) should get out of the way of the user and should instead let the user focus on their task (for example, a user should not have to spend time learning how to troubleshoot their OS so that they can eventually do their schoolwork before their deadline). 
The approach taken here to _get out of the user's way_ is the development of tools that can abstract and automate any possible processes and details in the day-to-day usage of Linux.
